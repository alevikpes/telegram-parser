# telegram-bot

This script logs in as a user and can perform actions on behalf of
the currently logged in user.

At the moment it can: 
- get all the groups, where the user is subscribed 
- get a list of users of some of those groups.
- send message to all users from Database

This script cannot get the users
of any group due to some kind of restrictions, which the group admins
place for in the groups.

Get the [**source code**](https://github.com/alevikpes/telegram-parser.git)
from github.


### Initialisation

##### User application
In order to start using this bot, it is necessary to obtain **API ID** and
**API HASH** for your user account.

It can be done via https://my.telegram.org/.
Enter your phone number, verify with the sent code and go to the
**API Development Tools** page. There create an app and copy API ID
and API HASH.

##### Bot
If there is a plan to use a bot, then the bot must be created via the
**BotFather** in any Telegram application. See
[**Telegram instructions**](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).
Such bot will have a name and a token, which also must be stored.

**NOTE** Bots cannot perform all the actions, so the creation of the
user application, as desribed above, may be necessary for certain tasks.

**WARNING** Never give anyone the credentials of neither your
user application nor your bot. Also add to the ignore list of your VCS,
the files, which have the credentials stored.


### Setup

##### Environment variables
Create a file `.env` and save there the **API ID**, the **API HASH**,
the **bot name**, the **bot token**, a **database name** (can be any),
a **session name** (can be any) and, possibly, other required data in
the following format:
```
APP_API_HASH=<your api hash>
APP_API_ID=<your api id>
DB_NAME=<your database name>
SESSION_NAME=<your session name>
TG_BOT_NAME=<bot name>
TG_BOT_TOKEN=<bot token>
...
```

**NOTE** Do not use spaces or other special characters in your custom names.

**WARNING** Never give anyone the credentials of neither your
user application nor your bot. Also add to the ignore list of your VCS,
the files, which have the credentials stored.

##### Virtual environment
Create a python virtual environment (search online about how to do it
for your OS). On Linux Debian distros it can be done with:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv -y
python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual-environment
```
Start your virtual environment:
```bash
source /path/to/virtual-environment/bin/activate
```
Install the requirements:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


##### Initialisation
Run `init.py` file:
```bash
python3 init.py
```
This will create an sqlite database file with two tables `group` and `user`.
The name of the file will be read from the `.env` file. See `init.py` for
more details.


### Parsing

After the initialisation it is all ready for parsing channels and users.

**NOTE** Always start your virtual environment before executing the sripts:
```bash
source /path/to/virtual-environment/bin/activate
```

Run `main.py` to start the parsing:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The script will parse the channels
and save their info and the data of the participants of those channels into the
database.

In order to parse only one channel, use -g optional argument with the cahnnel
`username` (the name which starts with `@` symbol and can be found in the
channel info page, specifying `@` is not necessary):
```bash
python3 main.py -g <channel username>
```

### Sender
This sript send messages all users which you parsed early.

Run `send.py` to start send:
```bash
python3 sendBulk.py --message <Message which will be send> --delete --timeout 5
```

Options
```
  -h, --help,            show this help message and exit
  -m, --message, required Text message which will be send to user
  -d, --delete          Delete user from DB after send message
  -t, --timeout Timeout between send messages in seconds
```
